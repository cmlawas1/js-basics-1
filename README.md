What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
1. Most programming languages are similar in nature, so it didn't take me a long time to work on this exercise. I just had to search for the syntax and some special string operators.
2. The only part that I took a while before finishing is the last function, which was supposed to be the easiest based on the number of points. Only then did I realize I was not really returning the values from the other functions and was simply printing them. After adding return statements, the code worked.
